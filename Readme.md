# AutoUI

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ⚠️

This is the code of my semester project done at EPFL in autumn 2019. The repo is public to simplify sharing and discussion with other peoples, but the library is not production-ready yet.

See:

-   [Playground](https://mbovel.github.io/autoui/playground)
-   [Final presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ROqfj31E4LhuXtZKXkmfGrK6nkNwR9wwSiEMyGBDNYE/edit?usp=sharing)
-   [Website](https://mbovel.github.io/autoui/) (which will eventually contain some documentation 😉)
